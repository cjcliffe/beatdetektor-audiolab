Desktop application for the BeatDetektor library using OpenAL, OpenGL and possibly wxWidgets.

Platform targets are Linux and OSX.

The goal is to provide a testbed for experimenting with the algorithm's internals and attempting to target and enhance the specific statistical frequency onset phenomenon that allows it to work.

The application will attempt to integrate simple real-time controls for beatdetektor and configuration of audio filters with dynamic controls and visualization of data output via OpenGL.

In addition to real-time utilization it would be ideal to have an offline buffer and analysis option for automation, this application will explore adapting a buffered approach that will allow additional layers of processing and accuracy.
